# FormBuilderConditionalAction2
Set a matching form field's value as a condition for FormBuilder's 3rd party action to continue. 

An extra textarea field will be added to the 3rd party action options.

## Example

If your form has a checkbox field named opt_in  to subscribe to a 3rd party service of email campaigns such as Mailchimp, you can enable the 3rd party action only if the field is checked by adding:

```
opt_in=1
```
